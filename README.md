# ShetkarAI: Empowering Indian Farmers with AI (MVP Version)

ShetkarAI is an AI-powered mobile application designed to empower Indian smallholder farmers through accessible technology. This project aims to improve agricultural productivity, sustainability, and economic outcomes for farmers.

## About This MVP Version

This is a simplified MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of ShetkarAI that demonstrates the app's core features and user interface without requiring actual machine learning models. This version is ideal for:

- Demonstrating the concept and user flows
- Testing the UI/UX with potential users
- Presenting to stakeholders and investors

The demo uses simulated predictions instead of actual ML models to avoid heavy dependencies while still showcasing the app's functionality.

## Features

- **Simulated crop monitoring and diagnosis** via image-based plant disease detection
- **Basic soil health analysis** through smartphone photos (simulated)
- **Weather-based recommendations** for farmers
- **Simple, voice-first multilingual interface** (supporting Hindi and English)
- **Offline functionality** for core features

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Flutter Mobile App** - Cross-platform mobile application (Android/iOS)
2. **Python Backend** - RESTful API server with simulated ML capabilities

## UN Sustainable Development Goals Alignment

ShetkarAI aligns with the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:

- **Goal 1: No Poverty** - Helping farmers increase productivity and income
- **Goal 2: Zero Hunger** - Improving crop yields and reducing losses due to disease
- **Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** - Creating economic opportunities for farmers
- **Goal 13: Climate Action** - Enabling climate-smart farming practices through recommendations

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file and add your actual configuration values.

### Development
1. Run the development server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be available at http://localhost:5001

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main application entry point
- `backend/`: Server-side code
  - `api/`: API routes
  - `templates/`: HTML templates
  - `static/`: Static assets
  - `utils/`: Utility functions

## Git Ignore
The project includes a `.gitignore` file that prevents committing:
- Python bytecode files
- Virtual environment directories
- Environment variables (.env)
- Logs and temporary files
- IDE/editor specific files
- Uploaded files in `backend/static/uploads/`

Make sure to keep your sensitive information in the `.env` file which will not be committed to the repository.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- Flask (Python web framework)
- NumPy (for simulated predictions)
- OpenCV (basic image handling)
- MongoDB (Data storage, future implementation)

### Mobile App
- Flutter (Cross-platform framework)
- Provider (State management)
- HTTP package (API communication)
- Image Picker (Camera and gallery integration)
- Geolocator (Location services)

## Moving Beyond the MVP

To evolve this MVP into a production-ready application with real AI capabilities:

1. Integrate actual ML models for disease detection and soil analysis
2. Add TensorFlow/PyTorch dependencies back to requirements.txt
3. Modify the model files to use actual model inference instead of simulations
4. Train models on relevant datasets for Indian agriculture
